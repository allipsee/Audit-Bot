Audit Bot is a simple open source discord bot which will scan your basic server's settings and potential vulnerablilities. It'll scan through roles and server settings, it may even safe you from raid or spambot attack. It automates searching and points out what should be changed. 
This includes:
  - What roles are mentionable.
  - What roles have dangerous permissions.
  - What settings in your server should be changed.

# Features

  - Scanning single vectors or performing a full scan. All of those returning a nice and clear report.
  - Availability for Administrators only for secure usage to prevent eventual vulnerabilites disclosure.

  
  # Installation. IF YOU DONT KNOE HOW TO RETRIEVE A BOT'S TOKEN READ THIS OR IF YOU KNOW SKIP THIS WHOLE PART
  *How to invite the bot? Unfortunately you can't invite the bot. BUT you can make it yourself pretty easily by copying the code from audit.py, and at the bottom it says TOKEN. In this field you must add the token of the bot you have created in https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ and if you haven't made a bot yet, what you must do is: 1. Click on New Application and you must name your bot **Audit** and press Create. Your application is still not a bot. If you want you can give it a description. 2. Then head over to Bot which you will see bellow OAuth2, press Add Bot and click Yes do it! Gongratulations! Your bot is now created! You can give it a Profile Picture if you want. 3. Now you must invite your bot to the server you want. Go to OAuth2, go at the bottom and you will se some checkable boxes. Click the bot one and then scroll down where you will find more checkable boxes. There, click Administrator and hit the blue Copy button and open this link in a new page, select the server you want the bot and now you should see the bot offline! Don't forget to navigate to the Bot page again scroll up and hit the big blue Copy button.*
  
  To make the bot online as I said above you must copy the Token of the bot the big blue button I said in the end, and then you must download an editor for programming, in my opinion the best is Atom. For you that you have a different one it is completely fine! Do whatever I say in your editor. Now paste the entire code from bot.py in a file on the editor, (make sure the file is .py or it won't work) and scroll down until you see this: https://gyazo.com/874da132a1a0cb51e6a3b37ea3952e26 . Where it says Token put the token of your bot! And then go up or down wherever you are in your code, until you find this: https://gyazo.com/7050eec5ea038117c35ea06734865f39 . Where the numbers are, replace them, **ONLY THE NUMBERS** with your Bot's ID. Then run the code and the bot should be online! Make sure to Mention the bot so you can see the commands.  **DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE CODE OR THE BOT WONT WORK. I AM NOT REPSONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO IN THE CODE BUT YOU CAN COME HERE AND COPY THE RIGHT ONE**
